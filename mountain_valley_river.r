#1: Create a dataset of physical and mental health characteristics of individuals.

data <- data.frame(physical_health = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10), mental_health = c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9))

#2: Determine the median for both physical and mental health characteristics.

median_physical_health <- median(data$physical_health, na.rm = TRUE)
median_mental_health <- median(data$mental_health, na.rm = TRUE)

#3: Calculate the number of people above and below the median on each characteristic.

above_median_physical_health <- sum(data$physical_health > median_physical_health)
below_median_physical_health <- sum(data$physical_health <= median_physical_health)
above_median_mental_health <- sum(data$mental_health > median_mental_health)
below_median_mental_health <- sum(data$mental_health <= median_mental_health)

#4: Plot the results using a chart to help visualize the findings.

barplot(c(above_median_physical_health, 
           below_median_physical_health,
           above_median_mental_health, 
           below_median_mental_health), 
        main='Health Characteristics Distribution', 
        xlab='Health Characteristic', 
        ylab='Number of People', 
        col=c('red', 'blue'), 
        names.arg=c('Above Median Physical', 
                    'Below Median Physical', 
                    'Above Median Mental', 
                    'Below Median Mental'))

#5: Create a survey to collect feedback about access to healthcare services.

survey_questions <- c("Do you have easy access to healthcare services?", 
                      "How satisfied are you with the healthcare services you receive?", 
                      "How often do you use healthcare services?")

#6: Collect responses from individuals who have responded to the survey.

responses <- c(1, 5, 2)

#7: Calculate the average response to each question in the survey.

average_response_first_question <- mean(responses[1], na.rm = TRUE)
average_response_second_question <- mean(responses[2], na.rm = TRUE)
average_response_third_question <- mean(responses[3], na.rm = TRUE)

#8: Create a pie chart to visually summarize the results.

pie(c(average_response_first_question, 
      average_response_second_question, 
      average_response_third_question), 
    main='Survey Results', 
    col=c('red', 'green', 'blue'), 
    labels=c('Access', 'Satisfaction', 'Use Frequency'))

#9: Use the results from the survey and the chart to identify areas for improvement.

if (average_response_first_question < 4) {
  cat('Identify barriers to healthcare access for individuals in the community.\n')
}
if (average_response_second_question < 4) {
  cat('Evaluate current healthcare services and make improvements as needed.\n')
}
if (average_response_third_question < 4) {
  cat('Promote healthcare services in the community to increase utilization.\n')
}

#10: Create a program to provide support and resources to individuals who need them.

resources <- c('Financial Assistance', 
               'Mental Health Services', 
               'Home Health Services')

#11: Establish an information hotline for individuals to call for help.

hotline_number <- '1-800-456-7890'

#12: Develop a website to provide further information about the program.

website <- 'www.inclusivesociety.org'

#13: Create and distribute informational flyers to the community.

#14: Organize workshops to educate the community about the program.

#15: Reach out to local organizations to partner with the program.

#16: Develop a social media presence to increase awareness.

#17: Identify potential sponsors to fund the program.

#18: Connect with existing support groups to increase visibility.

#19: Engage with local policy makers to ensure support for the program.

#20: Monitor the impact of the program to evaluate its success.
